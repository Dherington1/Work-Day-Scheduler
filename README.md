# Work-Day-Scheduler

For this project, I was given the task of making a simple work day scheduler that was color-coded based on past, present, and future timeblocks in the work day. Using jQuery, I was asked to save items to local storage and display them in the given calendar block, without losing the items upon a page refresh.
